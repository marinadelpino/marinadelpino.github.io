<h3>One of my favourite songs is <em>What about us</em></h3>
<h4>Here you can see the lyrics</h4>

    <p> We are searchlights, we can see in the dark <br>
We are rockets, pointed up at the stars <br>
We are billions of beautiful hearts <br>
And you sold us down the river too far <br>
<p class="chours">
What about us? <br>
What about all the times you said you had the answers?<br>
What about us?<br>
What about all the broken happy ever afters?<br>
What about us?<br>
What about all the plans that ended in disaster?<br>
What about love? What about trust?<br>
What about us?<br>
</p>

<p>
We are problems that want to be solved<br>
We are children that need to be loved<br>
We were willing, we came when you called<br>
But many fooled us, enough is enough<br>
</p>
<p class="chours">
What about us?<br>
What about all the times you said you had the answers?<br>
What about us?<br>
What about all the broken happy ever afters?<br>
What about us?<br>
What about all the plans that ended in disaster?<br>
What about love? What about trust?<br>
What about us?<br>
</p>
What about us?<br>
What about all the plans that ended in disaster?<br>
What about love? What about trust?<br>
What about us?<br>
<p>
Sticks and stones they may break these bones<br>
But then I'll be ready, are you ready?<br>
It's the start of us, waking up, come on<br>
Are you ready? I'll be ready<br>
I don't want control, I want to let go<br>
Are you ready? I'll be ready<br>
Cause now it's time to let them know<br>
We are ready<br>
</p>
<p class="chours">
What about...<br>
What about us?<br>
What about all the times you said you had the answers?<br>
So what about us?<br>
What about all the broken happy ever afters?<br>
What about us?<br>
What about all the plans that ended in disaster?<br>
What about love? What about trust?<br>
What about us?<br>
</p>

<p>
What about us?<br>
What about us?<br>
What about us?<br>
<br>
What about us?<br>
What about us?<br>
What about us?<br>
